Dogen was a Zen monk in the early Kamakura period.
The founder of Soto Zen
Later in his life he also went by the name Kigen.
Within the sect he is referred to by the honorary title Koso.
Posthumously named Bussho Dento Kokushi, or Joyo-Daishi.
He is generally called Dogen Zenji.
He is reputed to have been the one that spread the practices of tooth brushing, face washing, table manners and cleaning in Japan.
Another story has it that he was the first one to bring Moso-chiku (Moso bamboo) to Japan.
Though some points are unclear about Dogen's birth, all accounts agree that he was born in the line of Udaijin (Minister of the Right) Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO (MINAMOTO no Michichika or Michichika KOGA).
Although it is generally accepted that he was born in Shoden Sanso in Kohata, Kyoto, to Michichika and FUJIWARA no Ishi, the daughter of Daijo-daijin (Grand Minister of State) Motofusa MATSUDONO (FUJIWARA no Motofusa), recent research suggests that he may have been the son of Michitomo HORIKAWA, who was presumed to be his adoptive father.
Another account says his father was the son of Michichika, MINAMOTO no Michimune or Michiteru KOGA.
According to the biography "Kenzeiki", he lost his father (Michichika) at 3 years of age, his mother at 8, and was adopted by his half brother Michitomo HORIKAWA.
Yet another account tells that his maternal uncle Moroie MATSUDONO (former Regent and Interior Minister) wanted to adopt him as an heir after his parents died, but Dogen, feeling the uncertainty of the world, declined.
There is a story that he was acquainted with Shinran, the founder of Shin Buddhism, as they were related via their mothers; but there is no proof.
Some have said that the "Life and Death" section of his "Shobogenzo" was written for Shinran.
Kenryaku 3 (1213) - Visited his maternal uncle Ryoken at Mt. Hiei.
1214 - Entered the priesthood under Koen, the head of Tendai Buddhism, and took the name Buppobo Dogen.
1215 - Pursued Tendai religious studies under Koin at Onjo-ji Temple.
1217 - Studied under Myozen, a disciple of Eisai, at Kennin-ji Temple.
1223 - Left from Hakata with Myozen to Southern Song China and visited Jozan, where he received a certificate of dharma transmission from Soto Zen's Tendo Nyozo.
1228 - Returned to Japan.
1233 - Opened Kosho-ji Temple at Fukakusa, Kyoto.
Around this time he came under pressure from Mt. Hiei.
July,1243 - Moved to Echizen Shihi-no-sho at the invitation of Yoshishige HATANO, lord of Echizen Province.
On the way, he stopped in Kutsuki at the invitation of the village chief, Nobutsuna SASAKI (this is the origin of Kosho-ji Temple in Takashima City).
1244 - Opened Daibutsu-ji Temple in Kasamatsu.
1246 - Changed the name of Daibutsu-ji to Eihei-ji Temple, and his own name to Kigen.
Around this time he went to Kamakura to teach, at the invitation of Regent Tokiyori HOJO and Yoshishige HATANO.
Although he only spent half of a year in Kamakura, it was the beginning of a genuine flourishing of Zen in the Kanto region.
1253 - After falling ill and turning over Eihei-ji to his disciple Koun Ejo, he died at the house (Takatsuji-dori Nishinotoin-dori, Kyoto) of a lay disciple, Kakunen, at age 54.
Cause of death was a boil.
He emphasized that Buddhahood is not something that is completed once one has attained a certain level; rather, continuing to seek further Buddhahood through endless training, even after one has become a Buddha, is the essence of Buddhahood (Shusho Ichinyo); and the highest form of training is to be like the Sakyamuni and simply do sitting meditation (Shikan Taza).
Most of Kamakura Buddhism affirmed the notion of the decadent age, but in his Shobogenzo Zuimonki he wrote "I tell you now, this is completely false.
The idea of the decline of true Buddha-dharma is only a temporary means for teaching.
The true teaching is different.
By training according to the teaching, anybody can achieve enlightenment.
The monks at the time of the Sakyamuni were not all outstanding people.
There were those who had rare and incredible evil in their hearts, and there were fools.
The many rules that the Saykamuni made were for the bad and foolish people.
People are all owners of the quality to be able to become Buddha.
Don't think that you are not qualified. If you train according to the teaching, you will surely attain enlightenment." He thus noted that the disciples at the time of Sakyamuni were not all outstanding people, denying the decadent age by saying that it is nothing more than a skillful means.

The Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum is a preservation and display facility for steam locomotives, operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West Japan), located in Kankiji-cho, Shimogyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
On October 10, 1972, the Japan National Railway opened a semicircular garage at the Umekoji engine yard in Shimogyou-ku, Kyoto in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the first railway in Japan. The first of its kind, this facility preserves working steam locomotives, honoring them as precious artifacts of industrial culture that supported the Japanese rail transport system.
JR West Japan took over the facility in 1987, following the breakup and privatization of Japanese National Railways.
The facility itself is also an active depot (Umekoji Railyard), and carries out inspections and maintenance on steam locomotives and Japanese National Railways Diesel Locomotive Class DE10 owned by Sagano Scenic Railway.
Initially, this facility was established for working preservation of steam locomotives, which had begun disappearing rapidly in the latter half of the 1960s.
The Koyama engine yard at Koyama Station in Tochigi Prefecture was the best candidate for the locomotive preservation area because it was close to the capital, but the Umekoji engine yard was chosen in 1970 for its central location in Japan and the presence of other historic spots in the area.
Reviews had been made to select, in principle, lowest-numbered extant steam locomotives (#1 if possible) for preservation, but there are some steam locomotives, such as the Class C62 #2, that were not originally planned for preservation.
The facilities consist of the Steam Locomotive Display Hall, taking advantage of the semicircular garage and turntable of the former Umekoji Engine Depot, and the Educational Display Gallery at the former Nijo Station building which was moved and rebuilt at this location.
The semicircular garage of reinforced concrete construction (built in 1914) was designated as an Important Cultural Property by the Japanese Government on December 10, 2004, along with its 5-ton electric ceiling crane (completed in 1915) and access rails.
In 2004, it was also chosen by the Japan Society of Civil Engineers as a Public Works Heritage site.
In 2006, the former Nijo Station building (gallery) and the semicircular garage, along with the preserved steam locomotives as well as inspection and maintenance equipment, etc. were designated as Railway Memorial Objects and Railway Semi-memorial Objects by JR West Japan.
The former Nijo Station building, built in 1904 by the Kyoto Railway Company to double as a headquarters building, is now the oldest 2-story, wooden, Japanese-style station building, and was modeled after Heian Jingu Shrine with harmony with the surrounding landscape in mind.
It was used as a station building by Japanese National Railways and JR West Japan after Kyoto Railway Company was nationalized in 1907; but its use as a station building ended in 1996, following the elevation of the Sanin Line (Sagano Line) between Nijo and Hanazono Stations (in Kyoto Prefecture), and in 1997 was rebuilt on this site to be used as an entrance, with its original indoor facilities such as ticket windows being used as a gallery.
It was designated a Cultural Property of the City of Kyoto in April 1996.
The semicircular garage houses and displays 18 steam locomotives (originally 17 when the facility first opened) of 16 different classes - all manufactured in Japan from the Taisho to Showa periods.
When this museum opened, there was a rule that locomotives should be preserved in working conditions. In fact, 15 locomotives excluding the two (Class C53 #45 and Class C51 #239) were registered for operation. However, the scope of locomotives to be preserved has been reconsidered several times since then. As of 2006, 7 locomotives of 7 different classes are preserved in working conditions.
Of those, 5 steam locomotives of 5 different classes are still registered for operation, and 2 (Class C57 #1 and Class C56 #160) are in service to pull trains on main lines such as the Yamaguchi on the Yamaguchi Line and the Kita Biwako on the Hokuriku Main Line.
The others in working conditions are registered but cannot run on the main lines because they have not undergone general inspections.
Also, the SL Steamliner - pulled by a locomotive being preserved in working conditions for display in the museum - is running on the tracks of the museum site.
This display track once stretched north from the garage to the northern edge of the grounds, where there is now a parking lot for large vehicles (where a rest facility for the museum and a park were once located). In line with relocation of the former Nijo Station building, it was rearranged to go through the southern edge of Umekoji Park and under the Sagano Line tracks.
Today this is still a functional engine depot, and is connected to rail lines in operation.
After the closing of West Japan Railway Company's Takatori Plant, the facility has also taken over maintenance of steam locomotives.
Ume
Stands for Umekoji
All the steam locomotives, except for Class C62 #1 that was designated in 1976, were designated as Railway Semi-memorial Objects together with its logs and maintenance tools in 2006.
Unless otherwise noted, the steam locomotives were transferred from the previous engine depots in 1972.
Registraion of steam locomotives marked with * had been deleted when they were brought to Umekoji for preservation.

Shomyo is one of the traditional forms of Japanese music.
It is a chant of Buddhist scriptures and a religious music for ceremonies.
It is also called Bonbai and Bonnoku in Japanese.
It is written as 聲明 in the old form.
Shomyo is the name for one of the academic fields (Gomyo) of ancient India.
Gomyo refers to five academic fields - Shomyo (phonology and grammar), Kugyomyo (technics and technology), Ihomyo (medical science), Inmyo (ethics) and Naimyo (study of a scholar's religion, as in Buddhism for a Buddhist).
It was introduced to Japan together with Buddhism and became well established.
There is a record that a Buddhist ceremony involving the use of Shomyo was held at the opening ceremony for the Todai-ji Temple Great Buddha Eye in 754, so it is believed that Shomyo flourished during the Nara period.
During the early Heian period, Saicho and Kukai introduced Shomyo and founded Tendai Shomyo and Shingon Shomyo, respectively.
Buddhist sects other than the Tendai-shu and Shingon-shu sects also have their own Shomyo, each of which has been handed down to the present day.
Because Shomyo was passed down by Kuden (handing down from month to ear), there was no musical notation.
Therefore, its initiation was extremely difficult.
Later, Hakase was invented as an equivalent of musical notation.
There are differences in technical terms (such as Hakase) in each school.
However, Hakase was a reference to chant, and in order to learn Shomyo, kuden (also called roi, or direct initiation by an instructor) was necessary; therefore, conservation and inheritance were impossible from the perspective of a master to a disciple.
Therefore, the development of instructors and successors was a must.
Numerous schools were extinguished due to various circumstances.
Tendai Shomyo developed independently, in accordance with what Saicho had introduced.
After Saicho, Ennin and Annen made it prosperous.
Ryonin, the founder of Yuzunembutsu-shu sect, is known as the patriarch of the Restoration.
In 1109, Ryonin built Raigoin Temple (Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City) in Ohara, Kyoto.
Raigoin Temple, in Ohara, was called Gyozan as the temple's title, having been named after Gyozan, the birthplace of Shomyo in China.
Before long, Raigoin Temple and Shorinin Temple were known as the dojos of Ohara School Gyozan Shomyo.
Jakugen developed a school later, so there were two schools of Shomyo in Ohara.
Subsequently, Shukai restored Ohara Shomyo.
Tanchi established a stream based on a new form of music theory.
Since then, it became the center of Tendai Shomyo, and it has been inherited by the present Tendai Shomyo.
The Yuzunembutsu-shu sect, Jodo-shu sect and Jodo Shinshu sect represent the lineage of Tendai Shomyo.
Shingon Shomyo has been passed down to the present day based on what Kukai introduced.
Shomyo was systematized after Shinga.
Particularly, Kancho was known as the patriarch of the Restoration.
He worked on the composition and control of Shomyo.
There were numerous schools until the Kamakura period, but the princely priest Kakusho reorganized them into four: the Honsoinryu School, Shinsoinryu School, Daigoryu School and Nakagawa-Daishinryu School.
Shomyo, of the Kogi (old) Shingonshu sect, declined and became extinct with the emergence of the Edo period.
The Honsoinryu School, Shinsoinryu School and Daigoryu School were extinguished by the middle of the Meiji period.
Currently, it is divided into Chizan Shomyo (Chishakuin, Kyoto), Buzan Shomyo (Hase-dera Temple, Nara), Nanzan-shinryu School (Mt. Koya-san and Kogi Shingonshu sect temples, Kyoto).
Chizan Shomyo and Buzan Shomyo (Shingi (new) Shingonshu sect Shomyo):Shomyo of Chizan-ha Buddhists, Shingon-shu sect and that of Buzan-ha Buddhists, Shingon-shu sect were originally derived from the Nakagawa-Daishinryu School.
Raiyu took in the traditional school of Daigo.
In 1585, when Negoro-ji Temple (Wakayama Prefecture) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and went into decline, the Chizan and Buzan schools formed a school based on the traditional school of Daigo.
It features Buzan's 'Logic' and Chizan's 'Shomyo.'
Nanzan-shinryu School (Kogi Shingonshu sect Shomyo): This school is based on the Nakagawa-Daishinryu School.
The Nakagawa-Daishinryu School has Daishin, of Naka-no-gawadera Temple, Nara, as the founder of the school.
During the years 1232 and 1233, Shoshin, of Sanboin Temple in Renge-dani (Mt. Koya-san), moved his stronghold to Mt. Koya-san.
Later, it was called the Nanzan-shinryu School, being named after Nanzan, another name for Mt. Koya-san.
It is also called the Shinryu School or the Yasan Shinryu School.
The music of Heikyoku, Yokyoku, Minyo or Joruri can be said to be variations of Shomyo.
Its has had a great impact on monophony (unaccompanied music).
Emperor Tenchi (Tenji)
Male
Empress Suiko (626) - Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) (January 10, 672)
The 38th Emperor
Kokufu Shigo is Amemikoto hirakasuwake no mikoto/Amatsumikoto sakiwake no mikoto
The first name is Kazuraki (Katsuragi).
It is presumed that he was once called Kazuraki no miko (Katsuragi no miko).
He is generally known as Nakano Oe no Oji (Naka no Oe no Miko).
The "oe" means "prince," and "Nakano oe" means "second prince."
Overview
He was the second prince of Emperor Jome.
The mother was Takara no Himemiko (later called Empress Kogyoku).
The Empress was Yamatohime no Okimi, daughter of Emperor's half-brother, Furuhito no Oe no Miko.
The Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) plotted a rebellion with NAKATOMI no Kamatari and seized power in a coup to kill SOGA no Iruka, by which his uncle Emperor Kotoku came to power and he became a prince.
He established a new era--the Taika--and made many reforms during this period (he was a key person in the Taika reforms and Itsushi no hen).
He devised a plan to trap an opposition group that included Arima no Miko, who might have caused a coup in the future, and they were executed.
As Baekje was destroyed by the Silla (Kingdom) and Tang in 660, the Baekje prince, Buyeo Pung, who was staying at the Imperial Court, was sent back to his country to save Baekje.
The Emperor stayed at Tsukushi to send covert troops to Baekje, but Empress Saimei died in 661.
Eventually, the Emperor took control of the government without having an enthronement ceremony, but then he was severely defeated in the Battle of Hakusukinoe and moved to Otsu City to be enthroned in 663.
After the Battle of Hakusukinoe a castle surrounded by water was built, and Noroshi and Sakimori (the conscript soldier system in the old days) were organized to protect the territory.
Moreover, the system of ranking officials was changed from 19 levels to 26 levels.
In 670 the first national family registry, "Kogo-nenjaku," was introduced.
According to "Chronicles of Japan (Nihon Shoki)," the Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) wanted the first prince, Otomo no Miko, to be his successor.
However, after the death of Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) his brother, Oama no Miko (Emperor Temmu), defeated Otomo no Miko in the Jinshin War (the Jinshin Disturbance) and was enthroned.
Subsequently, Emperor Temmu's ancestry remained in power until Empress Shotoku.
After the death of Empress Shotoku, Sirakabe no Okimi, a grandchild of Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) was enthroned as Emperor Konin and subsequently Emperor Tenchi's (Tenji's) ancestry stayed in power.
It is said that because Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) took Nukata no Okimi away from Oama no Miko (Emperor Temmu), he sent his four daughters to Oama no Miko (Emperor Temmu) to become princesses for an expiation.
Brief Personal History
Born in 626
Rittaishi (the ceremony to institute the Crown Prince) was held on July 15, 645.
Politics began without having an enthronement ceremony August 27, 661.
The enthronement was held on February 23, 668.
He died on January 10, 672 at age 46.
(According to "Fuso-Ryakki", he died from an illness, but another explanation that has been offered is that he went missing in the mountains and that Emperor Temmu had him assassinated.)
It was one of the mysteries of the mid-seventh century that Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) did not stay in power for a long time.
Various theories have been suggested in regard to the matter.
This was the consideration for setting up Emperor Temmu's backbone.
There was an accepted theory that Emperor Temmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi (Tenji), but this is denied; another theory is that Emperor Temmu was Aya no Miko, whom Empress Kogyoku had before she married Emperor Jomei, and that he was an older half-brother of Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).
It is apparent that Emperor Temmu was older than Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) after tracing back their ages according to the Emperor Tenchi's (Tenji's) age at death in "Chronicles of Japan (Nihon Shoki)" and the Emperor Temmu's age at death in other history books.
The information is consistent in the same historical records, and there are eight to nine years of age difference between the two emperors.
Some people say that Emperor Temmu's age was purposely falsified since it was an embarrassing fact that the younger brother became the emperor before his older brother even though they are half-brothers with the same mother; but some argue that according to "Chronicles of Japan (Nihon Shoki)," Emperor Temmu's age was 16 when his father, Emperor Jomei, was enthroned, but it was said that he was 16 when his father died.
Therefore, the Emperor's real year of birth is 614, according to the Royal Family Tree (Honcho-koin-jounroku).
It was usual to have no successor to the Imperial Throne for some period (in fact, Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) and Empress Jito, who were in power before and after Emperor Temmu, took control of the government without having an enthronement ceremony).
Some argue that this caused the errors in their ages.
Some people have said that because "Chronicles of Japan (Nihon Shoki)" and other indicated history books are edited in different years and they are different in character, they cannot be treated alike."
Please refer to the section "The Age of Emperor Temmu."
There is a theory that the Isshi no Hen was a coup caused by Karu no Miko (Emperor Kotoku), in which Naka no Oe no Oji (Naka no Oe no Miko) lost his position.
It has recently been indicated that Naka no Oe no Oji (Naka no Oe no Miko) and Sogano Iruka had a relatively good relationship and similar basic policies.
This way there is no reason that Naka no Oe no Oji (Naka no Oe no Miko) would have assassinated Iruka.
Because there is falsification in the definition of Taika's reform in "Chronicles of Japan (Nihon Shoki)," this theory has become apparent.
This theory gets a lot of attention because it can explain Empress Kogyoku's abdication or the reason that the Soga Family (except Iruka) was not displaced from politics after the coup.
There is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) was delayed due to the complaints against his relationship with women.
This is based on the theory that Emperor Kotoku sent a poem to his wife Hashihito no Himemiko (Emperor Tenchi's (Tenji) sister with the same mother) indicating that Emperor Tenchi (Tenji) was having an affair with her, which is contained in "Chronicles of Japan (Nihon Shoki)."
In those days, romance and marriage were allowed between half-sisters and brothers from different mothers but not between half-brothers and sisters from the same mother; however, in the comic story "Tenjo no niji (The Rainbow in the Sky)," by Machiko SATONAKA, it is described that there was a romance involving this kind of forbidden love; Hashihito no Himemiko was persuaded to marry with Karu no Miko (Emperor Kotoku), but she kept the relationship with Emperor Tenchi (Tenji), and Arima no Miko was furious after knowing this and became angry at Hashihito no Himemiko.
There is a theory that Hashihito no Himemiko ascended the throne as the princess of the previous Emperor but one and became an Empress after the death of Empress Saimei; however, for some reason her name was erased from the record.
In the Man'yoshu ("The Anthology of Myriad Leaves)," "Nakatsusumera-mikoto" is considered to be Hashihito no Himemiko, and it is said that the one named "Nakatsusumera-mikoto" was a temporary Emperor until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).
